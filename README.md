This is a mobile application made for the Mobile Application Development paper.<br>
This application allows you to set a time for when you want your phone to remain silent and a time for when to revert to previous settings,
this was quite useful during university as it allowed me to not worry about my phone going off during lecture and missing calls after lectures.<br>
